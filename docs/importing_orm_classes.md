Importing ORM Classes
=====================

The ORM supports different styles of importing and referring to its classes, so choose what works for you from the options below.

Importing Everything
--------------------

It is safe to use `import *` from `clickhouse_orm` or its submodules. Only classes that are needed by users of the ORM will get imported, and nothing else:
```python
from clickhouse_orm import *
```
This is exactly equivalent to the following import statements:
```python
from clickhouse_orm.database import *
from clickhouse_orm.engines import *
from clickhouse_orm.fields import *
from clickhouse_orm.funcs import *
from clickhouse_orm.migrations import *
from clickhouse_orm.models import *
from clickhouse_orm.query import *
from clickhouse_orm.system_models import *
```
By importing everything, all of the ORM's public classes can be used directly. For example:
```python
from clickhouse_orm import *

class Event(Model):

    name = StringField(default="EVENT")
    repeated = UInt32Field(default=1)
    created = DateTimeField(default=F.now())

    engine = Memory()
```

Importing Everything into a Namespace
-------------------------------------

To prevent potential name clashes and to make the code more readable, you can import the ORM's classes into a namespace of your choosing, e.g. `orm`. For brevity, it is recommended to import the `F` class explicitly:
```python
import clickhouse_orm as orm
from clickhouse_orm import F

class Event(orm.Model):

    name = orm.StringField(default="EVENT")
    repeated = orm.UInt32Field(default=1)
    created = orm.DateTimeField(default=F.now())

    engine = orm.Memory()
```

Importing Specific Submodules
-----------------------------

It is possible to import only the submodules you need, and use their names to qualify the ORM's class names. This option is more verbose, but makes it clear where each class comes from. For example:
```python
from clickhouse_orm import models, fields, engines, F

class Event(models.Model):

    name = fields.StringField(default="EVENT")
    repeated = fields.UInt32Field(default=1)
    created = fields.DateTimeField(default=F.now())

    engine = engines.Memory()
```

Importing Specific Classes
--------------------------

If you prefer, you can import only the specific ORM classes that you need directly from `clickhouse_orm`:
```python
from clickhouse_orm import Model, StringField, UInt32Field, DateTimeField, F, Memory

class Event(Model):

    name = StringField(default="EVENT")
    repeated = UInt32Field(default=1)
    created = DateTimeField(default=F.now())

    engine = Memory()
```
