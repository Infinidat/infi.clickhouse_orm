DateTimeField and Time Zones
----------------------------

`DateTimeField` and `DateTime64Field` can accept a `timezone` parameter (either the timezone name or a `pytz` timezone instance). This timezone will be used as the column timezone in ClickHouse. If not provided, the fields will use the timezone defined in the database configuration.

A `DateTimeField` and `DateTime64Field` can be assigned values from one of the following types:

-   datetime
-   date
-   integer - number of seconds since the Unix epoch
-   float (DateTime64Field only) - number of seconds and microseconds since the Unix epoch
-   string in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` format or [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)-compatible format

The assigned value always gets converted to a timezone-aware `datetime` in UTC. The only exception is when the assigned value is a timezone-aware `datetime`, in which case it will not be changed.

DateTime values that are read from the database are kept in the database-defined timezone - either the one defined for the field, or the global timezone defined in the database configuration.

It is strongly recommended to set the server timezone to UTC and to store all datetime values in that timezone, in order to prevent confusion and subtle bugs. Conversion to a different timezone should only be performed when the value needs to be displayed.


Working with enum fields
------------------------

`Enum8Field` and `Enum16Field` provide support for working with ClickHouse enum columns. They accept strings or integers as values, and convert them to the matching Pythonic Enum member.

Example of a model with an enum field:

```python
Gender = Enum('Gender', 'male female unspecified')

class Person(Model):

    first_name = StringField()
    last_name = StringField()
    birthday = DateField()
    gender = Enum32Field(Gender)

    engine = MergeTree('birthday', ('first_name', 'last_name', 'birthday'))

suzy = Person(first_name='Suzy', last_name='Jones', gender=Gender.female)
```

Working with array fields
-------------------------

You can create array fields containing any data type, for example:

```python
class SensorData(Model):

    date = DateField()
    temperatures = ArrayField(Float32Field())
    humidity_levels = ArrayField(UInt8Field())

    engine = MergeTree('date', ('date',))

data = SensorData(date=date.today(), temperatures=[25.5, 31.2, 28.7], humidity_levels=[41, 39, 66])
```

Note that multidimensional arrays are not supported yet by the ORM.

Working with nullable fields
----------------------------
[ClickHouse provides a NULL value support](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/sql-reference/data-types/nullable/).

Wrapping another field in a `NullableField` makes it possible to assign `None` to that field. For example:

```python
class EventData(Model):

    date = DateField()
    comment = NullableField(StringField(), extra_null_values={''})
    score = NullableField(UInt8Field())
    serie = NullableField(ArrayField(UInt8Field()))

    engine = MergeTree('date', ('date',))


score_event = EventData(date=date.today(), comment=None, score=5, serie=None)
comment_event = EventData(date=date.today(), comment='Excellent!', score=None, serie=None)
another_event = EventData(date=date.today(), comment='', score=None, serie=None)
action_event = EventData(date=date.today(), comment='', score=None, serie=[1, 2, 3])
```

The `extra_null_values` parameter is an iterable of additional values that should be converted
to `None`.

NOTE: `ArrayField` of `NullableField` is not supported. Also `EnumField` cannot be nullable.

NOTE: Using `Nullable` almost always negatively affects performance, keep this in mind when designing your databases.

Working with LowCardinality fields
----------------------------------
Starting with version 19.0 ClickHouse offers a new type of field to improve the performance of queries
and compaction of columns for low entropy data.

[More specifically](https://github.com/tech/ClickHouse/issues/4074) LowCardinality data type builds dictionaries automatically. It can use multiple different dictionaries if necessarily.
If the number of distinct values is pretty large, the dictionaries become local, several different dictionaries will be used for different ranges of data. For example, if you have too many distinct values in total, but only less than about a million values each day - then the queries by day will be processed efficiently, and queries for larger ranges will be processed rather efficiently.

LowCardinality works independently of (generic) fields compression.
LowCardinality fields are subsequently compressed as usual.
The compression ratios of LowCardinality fields for text data may be significantly better than without LowCardinality.

LowCardinality will give performance boost, in the form of processing speed, if the number of distinct values is less than a few millions. This is because data is processed in dictionary encoded form.

You can find further information [here](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/sql-reference/data-types/lowcardinality/).

Usage example:
```python
class LowCardinalityModel(Model):
    date       = DateField()
    string     = LowCardinalityField(StringField())
    nullable   = LowCardinalityField(NullableField(StringField()))
    array      = ArrayField(LowCardinalityField(DateField()))
    ...
```

Note: `LowCardinality` field with an inner array field is not supported. Use an `ArrayField` with a `LowCardinality` inner field as seen in the example.

Creating custom field types
---------------------------
Sometimes it is convenient to use data types that are supported in Python, but have no corresponding column type in ClickHouse. In these cases it is possible to define a custom field class that knows how to convert the Pythonic object to a suitable representation in the database, and vice versa.

For example, we can create a BooleanField which will hold `True` and `False` values, but write them to the database as 0 and 1 (in a `UInt8` column). For this purpose we'll subclass the `Field` class, and implement two methods:

- `to_python` which converts any supported value to a `bool`. The method should know how to handle strings (which typically come from the database), booleans, and possibly other valid options. In case the value is not supported, it should raise a `ValueError`.
- `to_db_string` which converts a `bool` into a string for writing to the database.

Here's the full implementation:

```python
from clickhouse_orm import Field

class BooleanField(Field):

    # The ClickHouse column type to use
    db_type = 'UInt8'

    # The default value
    class_default = False

    def to_python(self, value, timezone_in_use):
        # Convert valid values to bool
        if value in (1, '1', True):
            return True
        elif value in (0, '0', False):
            return False
        else:
            raise ValueError('Invalid value for BooleanField: %r' % value)

    def to_db_string(self, value, quote=True):
        # The value was already converted by to_python, so it's a bool
        return '1' if value else '0'
```
