Change Log
==========

v2.2.2
------
- Unpined requirements to enhance compatability

v2.2.1
------
- Minor tooling changes for PyPI
- Better project description for PyPI

v2.2.0
------
- Support up to clickhouse 20.12, including LTS 20.8 release
- Fixed boolean logic for Q objects (https://github.com/Infinidat/infi.clickhouse_orm/issues/158)
- Remove implicit use of '\N' character (which was causing deprecation warnings in queries)
- Tooling updates: use poetry, pytest, isort, black

**Backwards incompatible changes**

You can no longer supply a codec for an `alias` field. Previously this had no effect in clickhouse, but now it explicitly returns an error.

v2.1.0
------
- Support for model constraints
- Support for data skipping indexes
- Support for mutations: `QuerySet.update` and `QuerySet.delete`
- Added functions for working with external dictionaries
- Support FINAL for `ReplacingMergeTree` (chripede)
- Added `DateTime64Field` (NiyazNz)
- Make `DateTimeField` and `DateTime64Field` timezone-aware (NiyazNz)

**Backwards incompatible changes**

Previously, `DateTimeField` always converted its value from the database timezone to UTC. This is no longer the case: the field's value now preserves the timezone it was defined with, or if not specified - the database's global timezone. This change has no effect if your database timezone is set to UTC.

v2.0.1
------
- Remove unnecessary import of `six`

v2.0.0
------
- Dropped support for Python 2.x
- New flexible syntax for database expressions and functions
- Expressions as default values for model fields
- Support for IPv4 and IPv6 fields
- Automatic generation of models by inspecting existing tables
- Convenient ways to import ORM classes
